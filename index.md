# Statistics with R

This location contains html files of the projects created using R Studio. The rendered html files can be easily navigated using the navigation pane on the left hand side of each page.

1. [Introduction to data and probability](https://kushanst.github.io/statistics-with-R/intro_data_prob_project_final.html)

   This project deals with a Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data set. The aim is to carry out exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data based on three research questions.
   
2. [Inferential statistics](https://kushanst.github.io/statistics-with-R/statistical_inference_with_GSS_data.html)

   Principles of inferential statistics are applied on a General Social Survey (GSS) data set. The research question is a very interesting one: whether there is a statistically significant difference in gun ownership in the US pre and post 9/11. Analysis starts with EDA and leads onto the hypotheses followed by statistical testing.  
   
3. [Linear regression](https://kushanst.github.io/statistics-with-R/Modeling_and_prediction_for_movies.html)

   This project uses linear regression to analyze the relationship between various parameters on a set of movies (data obtained from IMDB). Followed by EDA, a reserach question is developed and tested using linear regression and model selection. The final model is used to make predictions and the outcomes are compared with the real values obtained from online sources.
   
4. [Bayesian statistics](https://kushanst.github.io/statistics-with-R/Bayesian_project.html)

   The same dataset used above is now analyzed using Bayesian inference. BAS package by Prof. Merlise Clyde [https://merliseclyde.github.io/BAS/](https://merliseclyde.github.io/BAS/) is used.
   
5. [Capstone project](https://kushanst.github.io/statistics-with-R/Final_project.html)

   This is the final project in this specialization. This final project was preceded by an EDA. However, it is not incuded here because this project starts off with an EDA. The project is based on the famous **Ames Housing** data set.
